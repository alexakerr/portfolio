        <p class="welcome-message">About me:</p>
        
        <h3>Background</h3>
        
        <p>I hail from the vibrant streets of New York City, where the diversity of experiences ignited my passion for exploration and discovery. Growing up in such a dynamic environment instilled in me an open-mindedness and a drive to explore various avenues to find my true passion.</p>
        
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>My educational journey led me to pursue a degree in Business Management. However, during my college years, I took a leap of faith and embarked on a different path by attending a trade school to become an esthetician. This decision broadened my horizons and enriched my skill set, laying the foundation for my future endeavors.</p>
        

        <h3>Career Journey</h3>
        <p>Following my graduation, I delved into the world of skincare, working as an esthetician for four fulfilling years. Yet, my entrepreneurial spirit yearned for more, leading me to venture into the realm of candle making. What began as a creative outlet soon blossomed into a successful candle business. Through dedication and perseverance, I established my own brand, which garnered recognition on platforms like Etsy, where it achieved top-tier status.</p>
        
        <h3>Career Goals</h3>
        <p>As my journey unfolded, so did my aspirations. The experience of building and managing my own business awakened a newfound passion for technology and web development. Constantly updating and refining my website sparked my interest in the intricacies of software engineering. My ultimate career goal is to merge my creative flair with my newfound love for technology, contributing to innovative solutions and creating impactful digital experiences.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
        <p>Beyond the professional realm, I am an avid explorer of diverse cultures, cuisines, and artistic expressions. I find solace in the tranquility of nature and rejuvenate my spirit through outdoor adventures and yoga. Additionally, I am a passionate advocate for sustainability and conscious living, constantly seeking ways to minimize my environmental footprint.  </p>
